      <p>This website still has a lot to work on. I've started working on this site on Jaunuary 27th, 2025. Although I have experience with React.js and Three.js, I never had fully developed a site all on my own. This portfolio is not only a website with accomplishments I am proud of but a method to improve my understanding in web development. I am a eager and fast learner and would love to tackle challenges that incites my interests. </p>
